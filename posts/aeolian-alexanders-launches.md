I am pleased to announce the launch of _[Aeolian Alexanders](https://maps.isaw.nyu.edu/aeolis/)_, a NEH-Mellon funded digital publication project. This combines social network analysis, historical geographic information systems, digital humanities, linked data, and numismatics. Check out the site, or take a [twitter tour](https://twitter.com/RyanMHorne/status/1267718662242197504).

The project consists of a number of different elements, including

1. A jupyter notebook that displays the narrative
2. A jupyter notebook for a "lab book" for further exploration of geospatial networks
3. The project site that provides stable URIs and images for every coin and die in the study
4. Experimental visual displays for die linkages
5. A collection of files treating ancient empires as networks instead of polygons on a map
6. The full project database in SQLite

Check out the offerings on the project's [GitHub site](https://github.com/Aeolian-Alexanders).
