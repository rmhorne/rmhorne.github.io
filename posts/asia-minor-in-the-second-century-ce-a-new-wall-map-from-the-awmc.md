The [Ancient World Mapping Center](http://awmc.unc.edu/wordpress/) at UNC Chapel Hill has just released a [1:750,000 scale map of Roman Asia Minor in the Second Century CE](http://awmc.unc.edu/wordpress/blog/2017/02/22/wall-map-now-available-asia-minor-in-the-second-century-c-e/) under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Several years in the making, this map is a collaboration between several different directors of the center (including myself), domain experts, and other historians, and it represents the current state of knowledge about Roman Asia Minor in this period.

Intended for class or research use, the map can be printed, distributed digitally, or remixed as desired. It is the same scale and general size as the [AWMC's other wall map offerings through Routledge](https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Wall-Maps-for-the-Ancient-World-Set/Talbert/p/book/9780415677417), so if you are so inclined, you can add it to a "mega-map" of the Mediterranean World. Demand for the map was so high that dropbox suspended our public folder; you can e-mail the AWMC (awmc@unc.edu) for a new direct download link.

Although this project is a static map of Asia Minor, the data behind the map can be found at the [AWMC GitHub page](https://github.com/AWMC/geodata). In a future post, I'll write up how to use the AWMC geodata and the [BAM framework](https://www.lib.uiowa.edu/bam/) to make an interactive version of this map which you can modify for your own needs.
