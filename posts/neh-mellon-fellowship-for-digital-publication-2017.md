I am pleased to announce that I received a [NEH-Mellon Fellowship for Digital Publication](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/research/grant-news/neh-mellon-fellowships-digital-publication-2017) to continue my work on digital die studies and Aeolian coin networks in the Hellenistic era. You can find a placeholder page for the project at [http://aeolian-coins.org](http://aeolian-coins.org). The project's code will be hosted at [https://github.com/Aeolian-Alexanders](https://github.com/Aeolian-Alexanders).
